# myApp

An angular application designed to...well, that part is up to you.

## Usage

FIXME

### Running the app during development

Getting dependencies:

* install node.js
* run `npm install`

To see the app running in a Chrome Browser, run `grunt server`. A browser window should open and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Running the app in production

To build a distribution package, run `grunt build`. The `dist` folder should now contained all the assets needed for deployment.


### Running unit tests

To execute unit tests, run `grunt test`. A connected browser window will open and run all unit tests. The connected browser will remain open and re-run all units tests if the test files are modified.


### End to end testing

To execute end to end (e2e) tests, run `grunt e2e`. A connected browser window will open, run all e2e tests and close.
